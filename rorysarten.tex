In my roles I have actively worked to build and maintain a wide range of relationships that give me ready access to guidance and cooperation from those with experience and specialist knowledge. Because of my broad skill set I communicate and collaborate well with technical specialists, subject matter experts and leaders.\\
\vspace{10pt}

{\bfseries \color{altcolour}Technical} 
\\I have a strong interest in programming, system architecture and solution design. I care deeply about modular, flexible solutions that minimise complexity and risk wherever possible. I am comfortable working with several general and statistical programming languages, database types, data structures, API creation and use, and ETL software.\\
\vspace{10pt}

{\bfseries \color{altcolour}Analytic and quantitative} 
\\I enjoy complex challenges that require robust analytical skills and give me opportunities to exercise my strong numerical intuition. I am capable of using a wide range of analytic tools to detect, examine, solve and communicate problems and findings.\\
